# Force-Gauge
Get force measurements of strain gauges 

Please see "connect electronics.docx" for schematic of the system

This a system for measuring force on a system that is going through bending.
The engineering design uses 4 strain gauges and manipulate the strain change to a force using wheatstone bridge concept.
Each new use of the system construction should be calibrated and it is built in with the project code (to be uploaded).

The code is in c for arduino and uses http to show the force results every period of time which can be defined (need wifi connection)
